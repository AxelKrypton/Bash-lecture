# Sample solutions to exercises

In this folder, sample solutions to all proposed exercises can be found.
They have been developed and tested with GNU Bash `5.0.17` on a Unix operating system.
These are meant as starting point and they _can_ be improved w.r.t. many aspects.
For example, many aspects are simply assumed and not tested in code, there might be better variable names, etc.
This is left as further exercise to the reader.

**NOTE:** Although `printf` should be preferred to `echo`, I did not bother to be strict about this aspect in the provided exercise solutions.
A good reading about this aspect is [this St√©phane's answer on StackExchange](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/65819).

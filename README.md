# Introduction to Bash scripting language

Material relative to a 3-days crash lecture about `Bash` scripting language given at Goethe University in Frakfurt am Main in October 2019.

#### Slides, exercises and sample solution:

The course has been structured in three lecture sessions, each followed by an exercise session.
All material has been here uploaded and you can find here also solutions to the proposed exercises.
They are meant as help for the participants, who might want to cross-check their work.

## The Iceland bonus track

The Iceland's pictures included in the slides have not been uploaded to keep the repository small.
Compilation should not break down, though and placeholder images should be authomatically used.
**All rights on the pictures in the PDFs are reserved.**
Feel free to contact me if you wish to make use of any of them.

## The beamer theme

The beamer theme used for this lecture has been developed for this purpose in order to have a simple, but at the same time relaxing and appealing theme.
It was inspired by the [Code Course](https://github.com/Irubataru/beamer-themes) theme of Jonas, but adapted to the need of having versatile blocks (see `varblock` environment).
Also handy commands to use the four palette colours in the presentation have been added to the theme.
The theme has been included in the repository to allow compilation.
Of course, its files have to be put in the correct place, e.g. in `~/texmf/tex/latex/beamer/theme/` on Linux OS in the `color`, `font`, `inner`, `outer` and `theme` folders.

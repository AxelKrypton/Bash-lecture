# Introduction to Bash scripting language

Material relative to a 5-days lecture about `Bash` scripting language given several times at Goethe University in Frakfurt am Main in the context of the CRC-TR 211 collaboration as well as part of the PUNCH4NFDI young academy.
Refer to the lecture [table of content](#table-of-content) to have an overview of the discussed topics.

#### Slides, exercises and sample solution:

The course has been structured in five lecture sessions, each followed by an exercise session.
All material has been here uploaded and you can find here also solutions to the proposed exercises.
They are meant as help for the participants, who might want to cross-check their work.

## The Iceland bonus track

The Iceland's pictures included in the slides have not been uploaded to keep the repository small.
Compilation should not break down, though and placeholder images should be authomatically used.
**All rights on the pictures in the PDFs are reserved.**
Feel free to contact me if you wish to make use of any of them.

## The beamer theme

The beamer theme used for this lecture has been developed in order to have a simple, but at the same time relaxing and appealing theme.
It was inspired by the [Code Course](https://github.com/Irubataru/beamer-themes) theme of a friend, but adapted to the need of having versatile blocks (see `varblock` environment).
Also handy commands to use the four palette colours in the presentation have been added to the theme.
The theme has been in the past included in the repository but later moved to an own repository.
If you wish to compile LaTeX source code, the `TeXnicalities` package and the used beamer theme are needed and can be found [here](https://github.com/AxelKrypton/TeXnicalities).

\begin{exercise}[Technical]{A strange pipeline}
    Pipelines are handy and by now you know them quite well.
    To practice a bit with redirections, try to think about how to create a pipeline which pipes only standard error into the standard input of the following command, while standard output is redirected to the terminal.
    You can use this compound command to test your solution
    \begin{lstlisting}[style=MyBash]
        { echo "I'm stdout"; echo "I'm stderr" >&2; }
    \end{lstlisting}
    and pipe it to the \bash|rev| command to see that the effect should have effect on the standard error only.
\end{exercise}

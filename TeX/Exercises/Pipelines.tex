\begin{exercise}[Technical]{A strange pipeline}
    Pipelines are handy and by now you will know them quite well.
    To practice a bit with redirections, try to think about how having a pipeline which redirect only standard error to the following command, while standard output is redirected to the terminal.
    You can use this compound command to test your solution
    \begin{lstlisting}[style=MyBash]
        { echo "I'm stdout"; echo "I'm stderr" >&2; }
    \end{lstlisting}
    and pipe to the \bash|rev| command to see that the effect should have effect on the standard error only.
\end{exercise}

% { echo "I'm stdout"; echo "I'm stderr" >&2; } 3>&1 1>&2 2>&3 3>&- | rev

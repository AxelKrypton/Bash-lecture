\begin{exercise}[Inspirational]{Rebinding the up and down arrows}
    If you did not know it already, today you discovered the GNU Redline library.
    You were also provided with some examples to bind differently keyboard shortcuts or single keystrokes.
    It is probably instructive to have a look to the output of the following couple of commands
    \begin{lstlisting}[style=myBash]
        bind -p | less
        bind -P | less
    \end{lstlisting}
    with the help of section 8.4 the bash manual.
    
    Afterwards, try to rebind the up and down arrow in your terminal as suggested in the lecture and explore how it works.
    Do you like it?

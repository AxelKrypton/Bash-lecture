\begin{exercise}[Instructive]{Loops, loops everywhere}
    Consider the following tasks and write for each a short script.
    \begin{enumerate}[after=\vspace{-0.6\baselineskip}]
        \item Given two extensions, rename all files in the present folder having the first extension, changing it in the second provided one.
        \item Suppose to have files in a folder with spaces in the name.
              Create a script to rename them, replacing each space with an underscore.
              Use the touch command with the brace-expansion feature in order to create a test environment to test your script.
        \item Create an empty folder and move into it.
              Create some empty files via
              \begin{lstlisting}[style=MyBash, numbers=none]
                  touch conf.{,{1000..200000..5000},save} prng.{,{1000..180000..3000},save}
              \end{lstlisting}
              Implement a script that
              \begin{enumerate}[after=\vspace{-0.6\baselineskip}]
                  \item deletes conf or prng files, if a prng or conf with the same number is not present;
                  \item find the largest number for which both a conf and a prng file exits.
              \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}

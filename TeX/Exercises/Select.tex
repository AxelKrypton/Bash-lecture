\begin{exercise}[Instructive]{A completely meaningless game (for humans)}
    For sure you will know the game in which you have to find the word not belonging to a given group of words.
    In this exercise we want to implement a variation of it\ldots\ let's say for robots who cannot find a logic and just guess.
    The final game should ask the user interactively how many words should be in the group, display a group of random words and then ask which one does not belong to the group and repeat the question until the user guesses correctly.
    A couple of remarks:
    \begin{itemize}[after=\vspace{-\baselineskip}]
        \item Draw your words randomly from the system dictionary which should be somewhere like\\ \bash|/usr/share/dict/words|.
        \item Use an appropriate Bash keyword to let the user choose the word in the group.
    \end{itemize}

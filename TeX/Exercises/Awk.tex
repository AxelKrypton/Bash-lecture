\begin{exercise}[Instructive]{Some tasks for which Sed can provide good support}
    Go through the few slides discussed in the lecture about \bash|awk|, focusing on the examples there.
    Once prepared an input file via
    \begin{lstlisting}[style=MyBash]
        paste <(shuf -n 20 /usr/share/dict/ngerman) <(shuf -i 1-5000 -n 20)
    \end{lstlisting}
    achieve the following tasks using a \bash|awk| command.
    You can assume that the file contains a word in the first column and an integer number in the second one.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Print every third line.
        \item Display only lines for which the number on the second column is smaller than 1000.
        \item Calculate the average of the second column.
        \item Print lines starting by a vowel.
        \item Print the first column word if the second column contains a number larger than 3000.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

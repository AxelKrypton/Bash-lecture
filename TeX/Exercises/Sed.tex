\begin{exercise}[Instructive]{Some tasks for which Sed can provide good support}
    Go through the few slides discussed in the lecture about \bash|sed|, focusing on the examples there.
    Once prepared an input file via
    \begin{lstlisting}[style=MyBash]
        paste <(shuf -n 20 /usr/share/dict/ngerman) <(shuf -i 1-5000 -n 20)
    \end{lstlisting}
    achieve the following tasks using a \bash|sed| command.
    You can assume that the file contains a word in the first column and an integer number in the second one.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Print the first 5 and last 10 lines.
        \item Print every third line.
        \item Print lines starting by a vowel.
        \item Print lines for which the integer number is larger than 999.
        \item Print the number of lines in the file.
        \item Print lines for which the number in the second column is multiple of 5.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

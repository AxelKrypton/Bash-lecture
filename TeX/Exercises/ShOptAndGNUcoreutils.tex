\begin{exercise}[Inspirational]{Shell options and GNU coreutils: Inquire about files}
    Write a bash script that
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item takes one or more file extensions on the command line;
        \item finds all the files from the invoking position with such an extension (also in sub-folders);
        \item prints a small report about each extension, specifying
              \begin{itemize}
                  \item the number of existing files;
                  \item the size of the largest file;
                  \item The total number of lines of all files.
              \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}

    You learn today about \emph{shell options} and \emph{GNU core utilities}.
    Use this exercise to do some practice with them.
    In particular, write this script enabling \bash|nounset| and \bash|errexit| options via
    \begin{lstlisting}[style=myBash]
        set -o nounset -o errexit   # equivalent to 'set -u -e' or 'set -ue'
    \end{lstlisting}
    at the beginning of your script after the shebang.

    Make sure to test your script, ideally in a temporary folder created for this purpose.
    Did you consider the possibility no files of the given extension exist?
\end{exercise}
